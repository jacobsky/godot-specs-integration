# Godot Specs Integration

For the guide section, refer to the [Introduction](docs/introduction.md) for more information.

## Important Note

As per the official [Godot-Rust readme](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust#further-examples) 

    Before launching the examples in the godot editor, you must first run cargo build and wait for the build operations to finish successfully.

    At startup, the Godot editor tries to load all resources used by the project, including the native binary. If it isn't present, the editor skips properties or signals associated with the missing NativeScripts in the scene. This will cause the scene tree to be non-functional for any sample that relies on properties or signals configured in the editor.
